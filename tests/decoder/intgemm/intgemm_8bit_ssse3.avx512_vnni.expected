Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain and is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain, according to the Post.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the court's permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly responsible for drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Malaga province.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of suspects in Estonia, including one leading a criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Mr Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with the Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the CCC, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the long-running work, we have continued to have convictions for crimes in Estonia and in Spain," he said.
Leis added that federal police officers were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men on suspicion of continuing to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting transfer to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison by a district court in Tallinn.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest verdicts, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Community criminal case, who had been ordered to pay BGN 80,000 for the criminal proceeds, or the judgment against nine individuals that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in East Virginia and in southern Estonia.
Confidential criminal proceeds there are around 71,500 euros.
Success in these criminal matters has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day, and if necessary, operations will be carried out in any European Union country together.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, which runs until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-Americans, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, taking into account the entire roster of suspicious racial events that have occurred recently across the state."
The NAACP said the group urged the travel warning to issue both a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of the color of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
This is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general's attorney general, which shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white people.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it's taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state for a number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel briefings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Foreign Office for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain intra-U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different types - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have a poor cost, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver, or liver cancer.
Mood Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, dark urine, muscular and joint pain, and the collar of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation, collaboratorial.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Extreme hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-related disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and from their hands to their arms, surfaces, objects, mouth and taking drugs.
Family members and carers of the disease, who are infected with hepatitis infection, or risk, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected men, men who have sex with men, drug users, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high-protein A.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination and those at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfectant, wash all fruit and vegetables before being consumed for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-armed, using blood-thinning creatures (toothbrushes, squatting tools), having donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-boy person, and having hepatitis from a mother to foetal/born.
The risk of hepatitis B infection includes injection drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and holeing, and using condoms for infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-cheek, using blood-soaked creatures, donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-prone person, and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/borne.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: a refrain from using foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and needles, tattoos and sniffing, and condom use in the event of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in hepatitis B or a superficial infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually and rarely infected mothers to the foetus.
Hepatitis D is a risk group for chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread fetal-oral tea with drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foeve.
Passengers may become infected in countries with hepatitis E in high disease.
Preventive measures for hepatitis are hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to squeeze the four-time Olympic champion off course in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I greatly miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row with a golden duo of the 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the cultural life of one of the art works in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Vienna.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information might have been worn out, perhaps a thinner subject, a narrower subject that allowed in the title to have more of an impact on the extraordinary story.
At the moment, there would be two books on the cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, portrayed in the single cover: Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and more comprehensive historical record of the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and who have himself in the Austrian capital, one can imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone turned heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where incursive syphilis was rampant and was Europe's highest suicide rate, does nothing more about the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten of Vienna's residents were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married Ferdinand Bloch, a Czech sugar magnate twice and Klimt, for her famous paintings, her father had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Dami in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
