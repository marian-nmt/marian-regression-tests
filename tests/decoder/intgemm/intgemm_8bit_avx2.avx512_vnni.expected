Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian subterranean world, known in the criminal world, was detained by police in Spain, known as Slava Kemerovsky, according to the Post.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo Criminal Society between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly responsible for drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mijas, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said the head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, said Va. Verte, a state prosecutor.
"We are not ruling out that the number of suspects in this case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with its Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a year-and-a-half probe.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work materialised and we have detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
The inquest added that Central Criminal Police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain.
We have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard for years.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been charged may continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting remorse for his surrender.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of extortion and sentenced to five years in prison by a district court in Tallinn.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then an underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxiderned taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest verdicts, eight defendants from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Community criminal case, who were ordered to have their criminal proceeds of EUR 80,000, or the judgment against nine individuals that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in East Virginia and in southern Estonia.
Confidential criminal proceeds there are nearly 71,500 euros.
Success in these criminal matters has ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and carry out actions together in any European Union country if necessary.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Muisuri, which runs until August 28, 2017, invites all African-Americans, visitors and Missourians to be particularly vigilant and extremely careful as they move around the state, given the entire roster of suspicious racial events that have occurred recently across the state and also been brought out."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law to issue a travel warning, making it harder to win antitrust lawsuits, and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target minorities in an unequal way.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled onto the side of the road because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so close complaints before," he said.
It is the first such warning the organization has issued to the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black man from Tory Sanders, Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general, which shows that in the state, black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of whites.
"It's meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouris documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state ranked 16th in the state's penetrating number in terms of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new law in Missouri that makes it difficult for the company to sue over discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel briefings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use the measure as a counter-reaction to certain intra-U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C are at a bad cost, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver, or liver, wrinkles and liver cancer.
Mooko Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Department of Health, says acute hepatitis is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sneeze, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and the collar of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease also comes from the popular name for liver inflammation.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined based on data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-destroying disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress in more detail.
Hepatitis viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stools of an infected person to their hands and from their hands to food, surfaces, objects, objects, mouths and drug use.
Family members and carers of the risk of hepatitis infection, known as risk-taking, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high-proteined countries.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination for people travelling and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene compliance is important: wash or disinfect your hands before using all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when a sick person is exposed to blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-dural, using blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, raspberry products), donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis-boy person, and having hepatitis from mother to foetus/born.
The risk of hepatitis B infection includes injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers and police who are exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk of vaccination, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, are recommended.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and holeing, and using condoms in the event of infection-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-armed, blood-soaked creatures, donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis person, and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/nonnavigation.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug addicts, infected person sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mother newborns, sick family members and caregivers, health, rescue workers and police officers, people with HIV infection, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
The preventive measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and holeing, and condom use in cases of infection-prone sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by a hepatitis D virus that reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection is found in combination with hepatitis B or a super infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with them contaminated needles, sexually and rarely infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through fetal-oral drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers may be infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Preventive measures for hepatitis include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, only drink safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to squeeze the four-time Olympic champion off course in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I greatly miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row with a golden duo of 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves much deeper into the origin story of one of the artworks of the late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna cultural life.
But even more in history.
The awesome amount of information would have worn off perhaps a louder cut, a narrower subject that allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
There would be two books in one place: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting "Daam in Gold," and a much larger and more comprehensive historical history book about the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever has himself in the Austrian capital, can imagine, without the slight effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel like a more grammar of cultures.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where untreated syphilis and was Europe's highest suicide rate does nothing more to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten of Vienna's residents were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't pull on all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Damid in gold," it's hard to believe that towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
