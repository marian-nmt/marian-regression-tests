Mr President , I would like to take this opportunity to wish you , the Bureau and all Members , a good transition into the new year .
ladies and gentlemen , before you leave me alone , I would like on behalf of the Bureau , once again , to thank all the Members , all the services , officials , assistants and other co @-@ workers and , if you will allow me - although all the co @-@ workers work for us - perhaps a special mention should go to the language services which help us to understand each other here .
I would also like , although they are absent , to mention the Commission and the Council .
I am not going to re @-@ open the &apos; Millennium or not the Millennium &apos; debate , but I am going to wish all of you , and by extension , all the citizens of Europe which we represent , a happy year 2000 .
