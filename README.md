Marian regression tests
=======================

**Marian** is a C++ GPU-specific parallel automatic differentiation library
with operator overloading. It is the training framework used in the Marian
toolkit.

This repository contains the regression test framework for the repo of
`https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev`.


## Structure

Directories:

* `tests` - regression tests
* `tools` - scripts and repositories
* `models` - models used in regression tests
* `data` - data used for training or translating

Each test consists of:

* `test_*.sh` files
* `setup.sh` (optional)
* `teardown.sh` (optional)

## Usage

Download data and compile tools:

    make install

Run regression tests:

    ./run_mrt.sh

or a specific group of tests, e.g.:

    ./run_mrt tests/translation

To specify which GPU device should be used to run tests, set the
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable, e.g.:

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 && ./run_mrt.sh

You can also provide a path to marian-dev repository:

    MARIAN=/path/to/marian-dev ./run_mrt.sh

## TODO:

* add a test for restarting training
* add descriptions of tests
* add logging tests
